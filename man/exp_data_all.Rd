\item{C}{A letter representing the apparent speaker category (b=boy, g=girl, m=man, w=woman) reported by the listener for each trial.}
\item{height}{A floating-point number representing the height (in centimeters) reported for the speaker on each trial.}

\item{C_v}{A letter representing the veridical (actual) speaker category (b=boy, g=girl, m=man, w=woman) for each trial.}
\item{vtl}{An estimate of the speakerâ€™s vocal-tract length in centimeters.}
\item{f0}{The vowel fundamental frequency (f0) measured in Hertz.}
\item{dur}{The duration of the vowel sound, in milliseconds.}
\item{G}{The apparent gender of the speaker indicated by the listener, f (female) or m (male).}
\item{A}{The apparent age of the speaker indicated by the listener, a (adult) or c (child).}
